# All Problems and TODOs :

## Login page

- [ ] The function isFormValid is not working correctly. I converted a string into a function, which is not the best practice, and this caused me to lose closure. (code: 0001)
- [ ] I'm not completely sure if importing CSS variables into two files is working correctly. (code: 0002)
- [ ] There wasn't enough time to complete the test files. (code: 0003)
- [ ] The APIs are not connected because I don't have access to the API documentation. (code: 0004)
- [ ] Compelete DOD markdown. (code: 0005)

## List of articles

- [ ] Show snackbar on delete article (code: 0005)

## Create new article

- [ ] Remove the question mark from the path; I added it to address the issue with the missing page parameter, but it needs to be fixed (code: 0006)

## General

- [ ] Add Defination of done and check project with that (code: 0007)
- [ ] Perhaps it's better to import every CSS component inside its own Vue component (code: 0008)
