- [ ] The function isFormValid is not working correctly. I converted a string into a function, which is not the best practice, and this caused me to lose closure. (code: 0001)
- [ ] I'm not completely sure if importing CSS variables into two files is working correctly. (code: 0002)
- [ ] There wasn't enough time to complete the test files. (code: 0003)
- [ ] The APIs are not connected because I don't have access to the API documentation. (code: 0004)
